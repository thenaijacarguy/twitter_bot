# Project Title

Twitter Bot

## Description

This repository contains details about the @BlackPythonLove Twitter Bot automated by @thenaijacarguy.

The bot is intended to do these things:
- visit theverge.com
- go to the tech news
- pick the first headline
- get the short text description
- get the picture for the headline
- get the link to the full story
- save the picture as a file
- upload the picture to get the media_id
- concatenate the headline, short description, link, and hashtag to form a tweet
- then tweet the concatenated text with the image

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The Python language is used together with some of it's most popular libraries:
* requests
* BeautifulSoup
* Tweepy
You can write your code in Jupyter Notebook or use an IDE like VSCode.


### Installing

* The libraries can be installed using pip 
```
pip install requests
```
* After installation you can import the libraries normally.
```
import requests
```

### Executing program

* Save the code in a .py file to be deployed on Way Script or any deployment platform you intend to use.


## Help

Ensure that the intended output for the script is displayed when you deploy it, otherwise it won't function as intended.
